        We often come across stories of people from "Rags to Riches" in markets and become so enamoured by it. Who wouldn't ! Afterall , we all wish to earn easy money and lead a comfortable life. What we don't focus on is the reverse " Riches to Rags" story (which happens a lot ) and is of utmost importance as we get to learn from the mistakes of others*
    </p>

        However before we begin the journey of investing in markets there are a few things we need to have ticked off from our financial checklist to ensure we sail through turbulent times of illiquidity, smoothly.
    </p> 

<p>  In this blogpost I shall throw light upon the areas which need our focus prior to investing in markets. These shall serve as a precursor to all aspiring investors out there .
Once we ensure we have liquidity, life becomes tolerable even during a catastrophe!
 WITHOUT THESE ONE SHOULD NOT BE ENTERING MARKETS IDEALLY .

                One must inculcate the habit of saving , early on in life. ONLY if we save, we shall have SURPLUS.
                Once we enforce this, we can ensure we have a surplus at our disposal by the time we turn say 25-27 years old . With good planning we can use the surplus judiciously for one's marriage without having to take any type of personal loan . A simple wedding without causing any undue stretch on our purse strings should be opted for . The money saved here can be utilised for post marriage expenditure. Believe me when I say the expenses shoot up a lot !! :) </p>

                Once our Education loan is repaid and Marriage expenses are done with , one must ideally start planning for a good Term Insurance . Our spouses may / may not be financially independent . Regardless, one must get this done ASAP.

                <h3>What is Term Insurance</h3>
                <p> It is a life insurance product which offers financial coverage to the policy holder for a specific period of time. In case of death of the insured individual during the policy term, the sum assured is paid by the company to the beneficiary(nominee).

The purpose of taking life insurance is to provide life cover to the policy holder and financial security to his family.
