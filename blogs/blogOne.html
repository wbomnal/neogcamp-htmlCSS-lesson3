        We often come across stories of people from "Rags to Riches" in markets and become so enamoured by it. Who wouldn't ! Afterall , we all wish to earn easy money and lead a comfortable life. What we don't focus on is the reverse " Riches to Rags" story (which happens a lot ) and is of utmost importance as we get to learn from the mistakes of others*
    </p>  
<p>
        However before we begin the journey of investing in markets there are a few things we need to have ticked off from our financial checklist to ensure we sail through turbulent times of illiquidity, smoothly.
    </p> 

<p>  In this blogpost I shall throw light upon the areas which need our focus prior to investing in markets. These shall serve as a precursor to all aspiring investors out there .
Once we ensure we have liquidity, life becomes tolerable even during a catastrophe!
 WITHOUT THESE ONE SHOULD NOT BE ENTERING MARKETS IDEALLY .

            <p>
                
                One must inculcate the habit of saving , early on in life. ONLY if we save, we shall have SURPLUS.
                Once we enforce this, we can ensure we have a surplus at our disposal by the time we turn say 25-27 years old . With good planning we can use the surplus judiciously for one's marriage without having to take any type of personal loan . A simple wedding without causing any undue stretch on our purse strings should be opted for . The money saved here can be utilised for post marriage expenditure. Believe me when I say the expenses shoot up a lot !! :) </p>

            <h3 class="heroHead"> <span style="color:var(--primary-color">Term Insurance</span></h3>

            <p>
                Once our Education loan is repaid and Marriage expenses are done with , one must ideally start planning for a good Term Insurance . Our spouses may / may not be financially independent . Regardless, one must get this done ASAP. 
                </p>
                <h3>What is Term Insurance</h3>
                <p> It is a life insurance product which offers financial coverage to the policy holder for a specific period of time. In case of death of the insured individual during the policy term, the sum assured is paid by the company to the beneficiary(nominee).

The purpose of taking life insurance is to provide life cover to the policy holder and financial security to his family.

<p>In the event one has purchased a house on loan recently , it becomes mandatory to take a Term Insurance cover which includes the outstanding home loan amount . WHY SO? 
    In the event something untoward happens , the house will be safe and will not be taken over by authorities for non payment of EMI'S. </p>

        <h3>What is Health Insurance ?</h3>
          
<p>Health insurance is a type of insurance coverage that covers the cost of an insured individual's medical and surgical expenses . One can opt for a good cash less insurance policy for a hassle free experience. Medical expenses at good hospitals are sky rocketing and it makes lot of sense to ensure this expenditure is kept at a minimal by opting for a comprehensive health cover policy.These days many employers provide Group Insurance.However it is prudent to have a personal cover as well .</p>

            <h3 class="heroHead"> <span style="color:var(--primary-color">Accident and Disability cover </span></h3>
            <img class="heroImg" src="/images/accedent.jpg">
        </header>
          
        <p>As the name suggests it would keep you financially secure in the event of an accident or a disability. But why is there a need for a separate accident cover ?</p>
          <p>Now while Term Insurance covers death by accident, it doesn't include total / partial disability due to an accident .
            The standard insurance does not cover disability. So imagine the ramifications financially , if one gets hurt in an accident and is unable to work a while or gets permanently disabled ! Moreover the recurring cost of rehabilitation would completely cripple the household.</p>
<p>This is an often over looked concept and to be absolutely secure one should opt for an Accident and Disability cover as well despite the fact that there are no tax exemptions on premium paid here.</p>

            <h3 class="heroHead"> <span style="color:var(--primary-color"> Emergency Funds.</span></h3>
            <img class="heroImg" src="/images/emergency.jpg">

        <p>
            We all are aware of this as the name itself is self explanatory .These funds are to be used in the event of an EMERGENCY ONLY . Today's world is extremely unpredictable given the pace of globalisation and obsolescence. Add to it the current pandemic and the effects of it on global economy  ! 
        </p>
        <p>
            We often tend to under estimate our requirement .The fund requirement depends totally on the stage of life we are in and it can only increase as we grow old ! 
        </p>
        <p>Setting aside a month's salary IS NOT Emergency funds . One needs a sizeable corpus. A year's worth savings at the least.The recent lay offs should be an opener for many .
            DO NOT park the funds in Equity (be it even Blue chip companies) and say it shall be withdrawn when required. Meanwhile let it earn some money ! The prima facie reason one keeps Emergency funds is for sudden requirement ! </p>
     </li>
          </ul>

        <p>To sum up, The journey to Financial Independence is akin to laying plinths for constructing a sky scraper . The building shall stand unaffected during a calamity only if the plinths go deep inside the ground and there are shock absorbers installed in critical places  . Financial literacy is our plinth in this journey with Liquidity as our shock absorbers as we go about to build our sky scraper of compounding wealth via Investing to attain our ultimate goal of Financial Independence! </p>
